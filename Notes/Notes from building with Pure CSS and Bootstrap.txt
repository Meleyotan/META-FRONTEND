thread of execution - running javascript code line by line
memory 


execution context - created to run the code of a function

an execution context has both memory and thread of execution 

thread of execution >> call stack

why is functions in javascript a first class object?

they are assigned to variables and properties of other objects

passed as arguments into functions

returned as values from functions

I executed my first c code today after many years of not understanding it has a special command line that builds c codes
I understood what powershell and command lines are for and how different they are: command line and powershell can communicate with your operating system
Today, I understood protocols as set of rules provided under the internet standard for exchanging data 
Basically client and server are the base communication points in computers
pipe commands are actually executed in parallel

cloud host service that lets you host git repositories

-la is short for list all 
-l is for list ordereded(hidden files are left out)


Git workflow
modified: it knows that the file has been modified
	git add for
staged
	git commit for
commited

git fetch
git checkout is used to create a branch

git checkout -B moves you to the branch

git branch shows the branches that are available

git push -u origin [name of branch] means the branch will only get update from the upstream

git status
untracked and unstaged

Git add is a command that marks a file to be included as part of a code commit

git add is used to stage a file or tell that a file should be tracked

git works on the edit, stage and commit pattern


pull request only comes automatically appears as a button after you push to the main/origin branch


git clone 
creating a clone to your machine is already a branch off the cloud repository
you can use
git checkout -B [name-of-branch] to further branch off your local repository
git add .
git commit m 'Your message between these quotes'
git push -u origin [name-of-branch] with 

this will create a pull request 

no limit to the number of branches you can have
 a team decides the naming conventions of branches

i have commited a .txt file
I want it ignored now

if I make a change to the .txt file that has been added to my repository before, git still tracks it, how do I solve?


Why do we stage?

To select changes to commit. You may not want to commit some changes with some set of changes, staging you allows you to commit at different times.

It allows you to commit incrementally, bit by biti 

It allows you focus on sets of changes
