// Custom.scss
// Option A: Include all of Bootstrap

// Include any default variable overrides here (though functions won't be available)

@import "./abstracts/variable"; //This is the custom variable file that you want to include before Bootstrap

@import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";//This is the bootstrap file that you want to include


// Then add additional custom code here
@import "../css/style"; // This is the custom CSS file that you want to include after Bootstrap
